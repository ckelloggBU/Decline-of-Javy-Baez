# Decline of Javy Baez
Javy Baez broke into Major League Baseball with the Chicago Cubs, and was a solid offensive performer for them for about 6 years.  He turned down a significant contract extension offer from the Cubs and signed a large free-agent contract with the Tigers in 2021, marking the beginning of a tremendous decline in his offense.  Iâ€™ll attempt to answer this question:  Has a change in the way MLB pitchers approach Javy Baez accounted for his struggles in Detroit?
